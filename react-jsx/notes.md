# An array of React elements can be inserted into JSX tags
Just make sure to give each of them a unique key:
Example 1:
```js
class Inner extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <p>test</p>
    );
  }
}

class Outer extends React.Component {
  render() {
    var paragraphs = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      paragraphs.push(<Second key={i}/>);
    }
    var result = (
      <div>{paragraphs}</div>
    );
    return result;
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<Outer />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

# "Attribute" syntax
JSX attributes must either be strings or an expression enclosed in braces:

```js
<Chat user="Bernard" max-history={settings.user.histLength} />
```

# Differences between functions and classes in React

# Some reasoning
In the examples, they only use variables that are extended classes from `React.createClass`, yet we used normal functions that just return React components.

I believe that `React.createElement` returns an object that is not a function. The arguments are `React.createElement(arg1, arg2, ...argN)`. To create the object, it interprets the arguments in the following way:
* `arg1`
    * `'string'` it must be a lowercase and match a valid HTML tag
    * `'function'`
        * If it has no prototype linkage to React, it is run and passed a signle argument `arg2`. It must return React components.
        * If it has prototype linkage to React, can be interpreted as a class, a `new` instance is created and `arg2` is supplied as the only argument to the constructor. Must have a `render` method in `prototype` that returns a component.
* `arg2` is an object that lists the properties of the HTML tag, or is passed into an `arg1` function.
* `...argN` Additional arguments must be React components, and are considered children.

When using the angle bracket notation in JSX, the name of the tag represents the first argument of `createElement`, any attributes are bundled into `arg2`, and nested tags represent `...argN`.

What if I have a class that does not extend React component? Hypothesis: as long as it has a render method that returns React components, no problem!

Indeed, it *works*, but React issues a **warning** asking you to please `extend` `Reactor.Component`.

# State
Reactor components may have a `state` property that can be updated with a conveniently provided `setState` method.

```js
// function that returns a component
var A = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Test</p>
    <p>Moar</p>
  <div/>
);

// can be rendered as is
ReactDOM.render(<A />, document.getElementById('app'));

// <El /> are function objects
```

# Insight

The object represented by
```js
<Comp attr="whatever">
```
is the result (`return`) of `React.createElement`. Therefore, the structure of this object can be totally independant from the structure of the object that results from
```js
class Box extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.stuck = 'to me';
  }
  render() {
    return 'I am in Box.prototype';
  }
}
var box = new Box();
```

As a matter of fact, this object is never even seen by the developer, nor is `new` ever used on subclasses of `Component`. Note that the first argument to React's `createElement` is the Box function itself.

How then are you supposed to have any control on these components? They must be controlled through the class definition exclusively, since no inference can be made on how what is done with `new Classname()`.

# Re-rendering

Components are automatically re-rendered when their state changes. I tried to manually change the state, and I failed. Probably I need to use the `setState` function.

So yes, `setState` does work, but it is only available on the object returned by `ReactDOM.render`.
* How does it work when it is being defined in a component method?
* Is there access to individual components' `setState`?

Is it possible that elements don't have a `setState` untill they are turned into a component? In other words,
```js
(<Tag />).setState({prop1: val1}) // fail
(var box = new Box()).setState({prop1: val1}) // works
```

YES! That is exactly it. Since in a class definition `this.setState` can only trigger a state on the instance of that class, I am led to believe that the output of `ReactDOM.render` is that very instance.

Now how do I get hold of children component instances?

# Binding of functions passed to children

Functions only need binding when they are defined in the prototype. If they are passed in as props, there is no need to bind them because props is attached to the object. No, wrong. The reason why they were bound was not because of their location in memory, but because the functions used `this`, and it was problematic when they were called in  a different context.

In this example, there is no issue because functions don't use context. They simply call the render function at the same entry point in the document:

```js
var onSomething = function() {
  // do stuff, no `this`
  onChange();
}

// Does not use context
var onChange = function() {
  React.render(
    <App att="value" />,
    document.body
  );
}
```
So what the blog post suggests is to have all data, the "source of truth" outside any component, and then just pass in handler functions and attributes with the information when necessary, and just render the whole thing. Sounds good.

# Special class methods

* `getInitialState`
* `onChange`
* `componentDidMount`
* `componentWillUnmount`

Does this guy only set state? Never reads state? Yes he does, find out where.

Note: `state` and `props` are bound to the component instance.

Diana is awesome. She goes beyond providing a room: she cares for her guests. The house is spacious and in a quiet area. Ideal for studying. There are plenty of nearby restaurants.

Note: `onChange` is attached to elements: the parent attaches "on change" events to children. A component can't define itself in the prototype an "on change" handler for itself.
