# Frontend

Why must we `import React from 'react'` in JSX?
App organization:
* Reducers
* Components
* Say you are choosing to display a component based on a property, how would you implement this?
* Do what types of values do you store in the store?
* Do you store functions in the store? Do you store any type of non-serializable values?
* What argument types do you pass to components?
* What is the most uncommon value you have passed in as a prop?


# Backend

* What middleware do you use?
* How are your routes organized?
* How do you deal with server side rendering?
* Is it scalable? If yes, are you implementing a SOA?
* How are you querying the DB? using an ORM or direct queries via a dirver?
