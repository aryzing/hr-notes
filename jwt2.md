Notes from https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/application_development/9781784395407/1

> OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that allows distinct parties to share information and resources in a secure and reliable manner.

**Authentication** is the process of validating whether a person (or system) is actually who they say they are.

**Authorization** is the process of determining what actions you are allowed to perform once you have been authenticated.

Oauth 2.0 is an Authorization only protocol. How to authorize protected resources. When the protected resource is your identity, then it can act as an authentication mechanism too.

> the OAuth 2.0 protocol can be combined with OpenID to provide an authentication layer on top of the authorization framework described by the OAuth 2.0 specification.
